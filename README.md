## Description

RocketRift is a simple 3D platformer game developed using the Unity Engine. This game involves using a rocketship and navigating it towards an end checkpoint without colliding with debris.

## Features

- A and D steerable rocketship, along with a thrustable control with Spacebar.
- Particle systems indicating successful gameplay or failure through a collision.
- Scene-switching between five levels with a persistent pause menu (and a neat splash menu as well).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in Unity Game Engine (Unity Editor).

The game is solely meant for learning purposes and is not planned to be released to major platforms, unless significant and unique features are implemented.

## How to Play

- Use the keys A and D to steer the rocketship left and right, respectively.
- Use Spacebar to thrust the rocketship towards the direction it is facing.
- There are two keys that enable cheats, are you able to find them?
